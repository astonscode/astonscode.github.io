Alone with my thoughts 
My mind is flooded
I don’t care anymore 
A mask I wear every day
Silence speaks a thousand volumes
Am I a friend?
Friendship shouldn’t feel like this. 
My loneliness devours me
Feelings that cloud my judgement
Create a pitch black gradient over my vision
I dont think anymore
Friends dont do what you did 
They only keep you around to keep you alive 
They dont care. 
Just get it over with. 
It won’t hurt anymore. 
Nobody will care. 
Life will continue. 
You can’t be forgiven. 
After what you did. 
You took everything away from us. 
You shouldn’t exist anymore. 
He'll go on. 
They'll go on. 
She'll go on. 

Without you. 

As I fade into the darkness 
They'll all forget what happened
To them you never existed
To them you were fine 
They blame themselves for your actions
When it really wasn’t their fault. 
“You could have saved him,”
No you couldn’t. 
I was already gone by the time you noticed. 
Because nobody notices a dying heart
Harming myself to set me free from my problems
Free from my thoughts
The very thoughts that guided me through 
Through pain
Through joy
But now are at a standstill. 
Unmoving

You were never my friend. 
I hope you know that. 
You were too weak to even keep going
I blame you for that
I blame you for everything
Drowning your sorrows in blood

You are me. 
And I hate you.
