# Evaluation Reasoning

Routine checkup for patient, now enforced under Section 7c of Codec 11-A.


# Medical History

Physical History: Patient displays a visible, faded lateral cervical laceration. Suggests a past injury to the side of the neck, though no accompanying medical history is available for context. No other reported chronic illnesses or injuries.

Psychological History: Patient demonstrates severe symptoms consistent with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including episodic dissociation, hypervigilance, and emotional detachment. Raised possibility of repressed memories or amnesia related to trauma. No formal diagnosis or treatment history for PTSD is documented.

Medical History: Patient has provided minimal information regarding their family. Refused to comply when asked. Without further context, hereditary conditions cannot be assessed.

Medications/Substances: Patient reports no current medication usage. Behavioral observations suggest no active substance dependence, but altered mental states during dissociative episodes complicate accurate self-reporting. Further toxicology screening is recommended.

# Observation and Examination

The patient demonstrates exceptional accuracy and advanced mathematical proficiency, capable of solving masterful levels of physics problems and theoretical mathematics within seconds and accurately predicting the trajectory and movement of a bullet mid-air. This extraordinary skillset suggests a high degree of cognitive function and spatial awareness, surpassing normal human limitations.

However, the patient suffers from significant PTSD, although they cannot consciously recall any triggering traumatic event. This condition is evident through their prolonged episodes of detachment and dissociation. During one such episode, when prompted back into awareness, the patient forcefully shoved Professor XXXXXXX and assumed a defensive, combat-ready stance. Their visible distress indicated a deeply ingrained reflex response, likely rooted in past trauma.

The patient also exhibits irregular behavioral patterns. Notably, they frequently address a crystal pendant worn around their neck as “Mother,” engaging with it as though it were sentient. Additionally, they habitually refer to themselves in plural terms, replacing “I” and “my” with “we” and “our.” This linguistic shift may suggest either a psychological coping mechanism or an altered perception of identity connected to the crystal.

Further testing will be needed. 

Physical observations and reflex examinations were highly above the average SJF operative. Indicative of advanced capabilities exceeding typical SJF operative standards.
