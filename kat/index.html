                These last months have been the most enjoyable, fun, and crazy months in my life. I'm glad to finally have someone in my life to share everything with. To not feel alone anymore. Before I met you, I was desolate. Alone. Crying every night in hope that the next day would be better. I felt nothing anymore and truly I was ready to quit on everything and give up. <br> <br> 
                But no, you changed that. You changed all of that. When you put that post on your story, I saw this as my chance; Once in a lifetime. And I had two choices: One was to stay silent, and continue painting the doors in my house, or two, take the risk and try to get to know my crush. You can guess which one I chose. <br> <br> 
                When we first started talking, I was nervous. Nervous to the point where when everytime you texted, I got butterflies. I was trembling with my phone in my hands and my heart was going faster than ever. Josin helped me stay calm and balanced while I was trying to collect myself upon the fact that I was finally talking to the girl I've been dreaming about for the past year and a half. <br> <br>
                But then, on that Monday, I finally worked up my nerves to ask you the question. The question that would decide if I would continue living in darkness, or finally be welcomed in the light. As my heart raced, I ran around, awaiting your response. When I recieved that text, the text from you, it felt... I felt... <br> <br>
                Joy. The thing I was missing. Finally, I felt happy.  And ever since that day, every time I'm with you, I feel happy. Ever since that day, I've been the happiest I've ever been. All because of you. <br> <br> 
                You are mine. You are the only one I love. I'll never love anyone else like I love you. You fulfill me. You complete me. You are the person who I can't stand a day to be without. I wake up with a smile on my face every single day because I know that I have the most perfect, loving, cute, pretty, beautiful, sweet goddess of a girlfriend. <br> <br>
                And I would never trade you for anyone else. There's not another living soul in the entirety of this planet that I'd replace you with. I want you, and only you. And when you say that I just haven't met the right person, or ask if I'm sure that you're the one, I look at you with the most astonished face. Because I knew from the start that you were it. You are my person. My favorite forever. I want to go through all the troubles of life with you, and I want to be there for you in your tough times, and for you to be there in mine. <br> <br>  
                Every time we're together, I feel at peace, like all of my stress was just lifted off of me. I feel like nothing else matters when I'm with you. Because it's just me and you. Every time we stare at each other, my heart skips a beat, and I get nervous still. Sometimes you just look so pretty and I don't really know what to do, so I just stare at you. <br> <br>
                I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you, and get a house, and grow a family. You're perfect, in every single way. And every time you do remotely anything, I wonder how I got this lucky. I'm dating my crush. I'm dating the prettiest girl in the world. I'm dating the most perfect girl in the world. I don't ever want this to change, and I don't know what I'd do without you, my love. <br> <br>
                happy seven month anniversary babe :&rpar; i love you
                <br> <br> with all the love in the entire galaxy, your husband, <br> aston
