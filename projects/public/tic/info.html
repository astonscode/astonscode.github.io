        <div class="text"> Tic-Tac-Toe is a game with very simple rules and is most frequently played among those of younger age. The game takes two players who each take turns placing their designated symbol on a 3x3 grid (X or O). The first person to mark three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is declared the winner. <br>
        While the game can be enjoyed without strategy, there are ways to ensure your victory. With optimal play, the game will always end in a draw, but a small mistake from either player could destroy their chance of winning.

        <div class="text"> The most early traces we have of this game are from Ancient Egypt, where they played with roofing tiles (1300 BCE). There were also variations in the games <span style="font-style: italic"> terni lapilli</span> from Ancient Rome, <span style="font-style: italic">three men's morris</span> from certain parts of Asia, and finally, the closest ancestor, the British noughts and crosses.</div>
