        <div class="email-body"> Mr. Clary,<br> <br> Last Thursday, I submitted my journal for World History. We talked about both of them briefly after class, so I was surprised when I checked into the gradebook and found that the journal was a zero. This assignment is tanking
            my grade from a potential A- (93.3%), and because of it, I'm getting backlash from my dad. He's very... insistent about grades. Anything under a B is considered failing to him and he really wants to see the grade change. It's not affecting
            me currently, but I expect it to in the near future. Could you go and check the grade in the gradebook please? I would appreciate it immensely. </div>
